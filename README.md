# UX

I've created a backend python script that is a pretend wedding check in.
This backend script could be used in multiple other scenarios.
In this certain circumstance I created it as for a wedding check in function.
In short, when the user arrives at the wedding they check in their name, what drink they'd like, what main dish they'd like (also with vegan or non vegan options) it then gives an option of a second drink before/with dessert and what your dessert pick is. Before the end it has an option to request a song and finally ending with a results function that shows the user every item they have picked for the wedding.

After all functions there's a validation check to insure the user response is correct.

I originally was going to create a restaurant idea with similar functions that would check the customer in whilst taking their drinks and food order. It was my girlfriends idea for a wedding design as it maybe more fun than a basic restaurant idea, thanks Jo!
